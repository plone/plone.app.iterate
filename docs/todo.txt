Short Term
----------

 - always increment version on checkout (iff doc is not upto date )
   - better offer form option.

 - default event adapter for setting workflow on checked out content

 - refactor policy, move all invariants to event subscribers
   [ locking, event marking, versioning ]

 - version adapters

 - refactor copier
    [ should create a reference ]
    copyTo - container
    copyReferences ( working_copy, state_storage )
    merge

[ requires hacks to other products that provide this functionality ]
 - disable workflow changes on baseline.

 - disable versioning on baseline. ( based on lock status )


Long Term
---------

 - multiple checkouts w/ diffs, merges and updates

 - check ref catalog for baselines
