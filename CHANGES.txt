1.2.3 - 2008-11-14

1.2.2 - 2008-11-13
------------------

  [nouri]

1.2.1 - 2008-11-11
------------------

* Refine permissions fix from 1.2.0 and make tests pass again:

  Don't require Modify Portal Content (MPC) permission on the
  original to check out, which was omitted in the fix for 1.2.0.

  Don't require MPC on the original for canceling of checkout, only
  require it on the working copy.
